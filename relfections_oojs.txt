Started reflections on Object-Oriented JavaScript course.

Before completed a short but sparkling course on jQuery.

What do I expect from OOJS - ? 
I expect to learn by heart technics and design patterns that will allow me to
start being a junior programmer. I expect to train the basic and essential
js programming skills and syntax.
