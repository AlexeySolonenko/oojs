Started reflections on Object-Oriented JavaScript course.

Before completed a short but sparkling course on jQuery.

What do I expect from OOJS - ? 
I expect to learn by heart technics and design patterns that will allow me to
start being a junior programmer. I expect to train the basic and essential
js programming skills and syntax.

Today, Saturday, and tomorrow, since now I am dying of sleep deprivation, I want to reflect on a beautiful
things that I learned from the course.

First one is constructor and prototyping. Finally, I got the clue about what does prototype word does.

Second one is more about the constructors and an actual 
difference between a decorator function vs constructor.
For some reason in Udacity they refer to a constructor 
like to classes. Let's try to memorize both terms.

it is important to learn by hear the iteration through object syntax. 
it is important to group objects in object in order to minimize the number
of stray small-sized object, and to allow object-property access and iteration.

It is imperative to understand, that a constructor function creates uniquye not 
cross-referenced properties of the objects. While a prototype creates shared properties.
Mostly prototyping is used for methods sharing. But a shared property, like for instance
a shared status variable active/disabled, might also be used.

Subclass.prototype = Object.create(Superclass.prototype)
shall be used instead of
Subclass.prototype = new Superclass(); - this is calling a constructor function, 
which is wrong. We just need to delegate the methods, not create new object
